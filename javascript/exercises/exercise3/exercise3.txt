// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var first = Number(prompt("enter 1st number"));
var second = Number(prompt("enter 2nd number"));
var sum = first + second;
var sub = first - second;
var mul = first * second;
var div = first / second;
alert("Sum is: " + sum);
alert("Subtraction is: " + sub);
alert("Multiplication is: " + mul);
alert("Division is: " + div);
